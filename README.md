# SPO PowerShell Scripts

This repository contains PowerShell scripts to assist with SharePoint Online (SPO) administration, including certificate creation for PnP PowerShell authentication and automated collection of file/folder counts across all site collections.

## Scripts

### 1. Create-PNPCert.ps1

Creates a self-signed certificate for use with PnP PowerShell or SharePoint Online automation.  
It exports both the `.cer` (public) and `.pfx` (private) keys to the specified folder.

**Usage:**

```powershell
.\Create-PNPCert.ps1
```

- You will be prompted for a secure password to protect the PFX file.
- Certificate files will be generated in `C:\certs` by default.

**Output:**
- `C:\certs\PnPAppCert.pfx`
- `C:\certs\PnPAppCert.cer`

_You may edit variables at the top of the script to change the folder or certificate subject._

### 2. Get-SPOFolderCount.ps1

Connects to all SharePoint Online site collections in your tenant (excluding OneDrive and App Catalog by default), enumerates all document libraries (including subsites), and outputs the total file and folder count per web to a CSV file.

#### Features

- Checks and installs PowerShell 7+ if required.
- Installs or updates the PnP.PowerShell module.
- Uses certificate authentication for best security.
- Recursively processes all site collections and subsites.
- Outputs results to a CSV file (`PnP_SPO_FileFolderCounts.csv` by default).

#### Prerequisites

- PowerShell 7.0+ (the script will attempt to install it if missing, using `winget`)
- PnP.PowerShell module (installed or updated automatically)
- A valid Azure AD App registration (ClientId) with permissions to the SPO tenant
- Self-signed certificate (generated with `Create-PNPCert.ps1`)
- Access to your SPO tenant admin URL

#### Usage

1. Generate a certificate using `Create-PNPCert.ps1` if you haven't already.
2. Ensure the variables at the top of `Get-SPOFolderCount.ps1` are set for your environment (TenantAdminUrl, ClientId, TenantDomain, CertificatePath, OutputCsv).
3. Run the script in PowerShell 7:

```powershell
pwsh .\Get-SPOFolderCount.ps1
```

4. When prompted, enter the password used to protect your PFX certificate.

5. After completion, results are saved to `PnP_SPO_FileFolderCounts.csv`.

#### Output

The CSV file will include:
- SiteUrl
- SiteTitle
- FileCount
- FolderCount

## Requirements

- **PowerShell 7.0 or later**
- **PnP.PowerShell** module
- **Azure AD App Registration** with the correct permissions
- **Self-signed certificate** for authentication

# Azure AD App Registration for PnP PowerShell Automation

To enable certificate-based authentication for the Get-SPOFolderCount.ps1 script, you must register an Azure AD application and grant it permissions to SharePoint Online.

## Steps

### 1. Register a New App in Azure AD

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > **New registration**.
3. Enter a name (e.g., `PnP SPO Automation`).
4. Leave the default settings for supported account types.
5. Click **Register**.

### 2. Record Application (Client) ID and Tenant ID

- After registration, copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**.  
  Youâ€™ll need these for the script variables.

### 3. Add Certificate

1. In your registered app, go to **Certificates & secrets**.
2. Click **Certificates** > **Upload certificate**.
3. Upload the `.cer` file generated with `Create-PNPCert.ps1`.
   - The `.cer` file is the public key only (never upload the `.pfx` file).

### 4. API Permissions

1. Go to **API permissions** > **Add a permission**.
2. Click **SharePoint** > **Application permissions**.
3. Add these permissions (minimum required):
    - `Sites.Read.All`
    - `Sites.FullControl.All` (if you need to enumerate all files/folders)
4. Click **Add permissions**.
5. Click **Grant admin consent** for your tenant.

### 5. Assign App as SharePoint Admin (if needed)

- In some cases, you may need to assign the app as a SharePoint admin for full access.

### 6. Update Script Variables

- Set the following in your script:
    - `$ClientId` = Application (client) ID
    - `$TenantDomain` = yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com
    - `$TenantAdminUrl` = https://yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com
    - `$CertificatePath` = Path to your `.pfx` file

### 7. Run the Script

- Use PowerShell 7+ and follow the prompts.
